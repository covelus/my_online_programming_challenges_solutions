# My personal solutions to publicly available online programming challenges
My personal solutions to some of the programming challenges availables online, the public ones that can be shared
In each script, I will link the challenge URL, and I have intention to describe the taken decissions.
When it is needed to process the input data, in some cases the same could be done using some external libraries allowing vectorization, but my intention is to solve it in two ways:
- trying to iterate in the most efficient way I can think,
- once passed, pass again the same using a vectorized solution.
